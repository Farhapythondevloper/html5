casecading style sheet

it is used to style or buityfy the element
<p> hi</p> element ko sajane ke liy css ka use krte hi

we need to learn only two things
1.  css types
2. css rules

1 css types - 
   i .inline css - when we write code css code inside html tag using style attribute
      then it is called inline css
      exampple -
      <h1 style="color: red; background-color: yellow;">hi all</h1>
    disadvantage 
      1.scope within element only
      2. maintanbility is very less and complex with html
    advantage 
       if all types od css implement so it will take implementation on priority
   
   ii. internal css /embed css - when we write css code inside head using style element
   iii. external - when we use css code in seprate file than it is called external css.
   1 .this file must be save with .css extension
   2. need to link css with html file
